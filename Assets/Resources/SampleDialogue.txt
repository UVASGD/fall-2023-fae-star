Hello, World!
This is a sample Dialogue script to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the Visual Novel system I have implemented!
You can do a lot of things with this script, and if you want anything more to be developed, just ask me!
Here are a few examples...
NAME:Mage
This is an example of the name box.
NAME:Character B
You can use the name box for up to two characters on the screen at the same time.
Within the script, you will have to preface a line of dialogue with the "NAME:" command to do this.
NAME:Mage
PIC1:MageRegularPortrait
The left box represents the character shown on the left side of the screen.
NAME:Mage
PIC2:Untitled
The right box represents the character shown on the right side of the screen.
Within the script, you will have to preface a line of dialogue with the "PIC1:" or "PIC2:" command to swap the pictures.
NAME:Mage
Respective pictures will be darkened for characters who are not "talking" per say.
To end a sequence of dialogue, you need to use the "ENDS:" command.
There are a bunch more commands than this that you can find within the "DialogueCommands" text file at the root of the repository.
I will also keep an up to date list of all of the commands that can be used within the scripts and I will share it with everyone working on the project.
Hopefully, this works for everyone for the time being :).
