From deep within the towering trees the quiet footsteps of a small mage can be heard. With a wide-brimmed hat atop her head and a makeshift staff in hand, she walks slowly through the forest. She treks further into the darkness before coming to an abrupt stop.

Where… am I?
NAME:Leoht 
...
NAME:Leoht 
I remember leaving Nihtcluain, but not entering the woods…
NAME: 
The dull thud of a knife hitting the tree trunk near the mage’s head startles Leoht out of her thoughts. Standing a few paces away is a caped figure holding a knife in his hand, with even more blades strapped to his belts.

Leoht.
NAME:Assassin 
And…? 
What are you here to do?
NAME: 
Before Leoht can respond the sound of a low growl is heard. A large, menacing wolf emerges from the bushes behind her.
NAME:Assassin 
Curses. They come yet again.
NAME:Leoht 
What wolves are these? They shouldn’t attack… right?
NAME: 
The cloaked man enters a crouched stance, knife outstretches as if measuring the distance. 
NAME:Assassin 
This’ll be the perfect chance to test my skill. You look small. I’ll fight with you, for now, anyway.
