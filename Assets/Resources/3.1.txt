NAME: 
Earl told the rest of the group about rumors he had heard during his time in the kingâ€™s army. Rumors of original monsters hidden in a labyrinth deep within the ruins of an abandoned town, destroyed by the corrupted beasts. Monsters that are supposedly responsible for the continuing creation of corrupted beasts. The so-called Creators. And so the group decides to work together to find The Creators and put a stop to their corruption.
