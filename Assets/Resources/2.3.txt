That should be all of them, hopefully. I trust you guys can handle yourselves.
NAME: The knight turns to leave.
NAME:Beda 
PIC1:Hacker_Neutral
Wait. Why not join us? 
NAME:Knight 
PIC2:Earlneutral
Why? You guys are more than capable of taking care of yourselves. Even… her…
NAME: 
He glances at Leoht. 
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
What?
NAME:Knight 
PIC2:Earlspriteangry
Fae have never brought good to anything. I want you to be aware of that.
NAME:Beda 
PIC1:Hacker_Neutral
Well, since Leoht helped us fight those things. I think it’s safe to assume she’s not trying to hurt us or anything! But assuming you’re from the physical army, I can see why you’d think that.
NAME:Knight 
PIC2:Earlneutral
I am… and I do hope you’re right and Oberon had not gone so far as to plant double agents.
NAME:Beda 
Please, he’s imperialistic, but not that smart. I promise. I have his central database. Just not the creds for that one mission–it’s driving me insane!
NAME:Knight 
Is it by chance the Madadh?
NAME:Beda 
Oh my god, you have it?! What is it? I’ll put it in!
NAME:Knight 
No not that. I think I know what it is. 
NAME:Deor 
PIC1:Deorneutral
Madadh… the wolves?
NAME:Knight 
The wolves, and wherever everything started.
NAME:Beda 
PIC1:Hacker_Neutral
That’s what we’re trying to figure out.
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
We need to find it. Whatever started this, we need to.
NAME:Deor 
PIC1:Deorneutral
Leoht?
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
I just have a feeling we need to go.
NAME:Knight 
You won’t know where to go without me.
NAME:Beda 
PIC1:Hacker_Neutral
So you’re coming??
NAME:Knight 
Well, I do still want to protect you all, especially since you seem set on taking on an extremely dangerous trip. Even with…
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
My name’s Leoht. And you?
NAME:Earl 
Sir Earl of–well, formerly. Just Earl is fine.
NAME:Beda
PIC1:Hacker_Happy
Well Earl, welcome to the team!
