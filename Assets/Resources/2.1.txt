NAME: 
Leoht and Deor find themselves in a valley of sorts. The two venture out together for some time before being forcefully stopped in their tracks by a buzzing invisible wall. Deor runs his fingers against it.
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
What magic is this?
NAME:Deor 
PIC1:Deorneutral
Not magic.
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
Then what is it?
NAME:Deor
PIC1:Deorneutral
Not sure.
NAME:Leoht
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
Very helpful, Deor.
NAME: 
Leoht places a hand on the invisible wall and a crackle that shoots out from their hand and wraps around the empty space in front of them in a large circle. After a brief moment, the wall dissolves, revealing a small building.
NAME:Deor 
PIC1:Deorneutral
How did you–did you do that?
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
Not on purpose.
NAME:Voice 
Hey! Who broke the cloaking mechanism!
NAME:Leoht 
Sorry, it was an accident.
NAME:Voice 
How do you accidentally break the super high tech cloaking device I designed? Who the heck are you?
NAME:Deor 
PIC1:Deorneutral
If you’re going to question us, show yourself first.
NAME:Voice 
And give you the chance to kill me? No way! Yeah, I see those knives you got there, and I’m not taking my chances! Why do you think I built this place?
NAME:Leoht 
PIC1:Mage_Neutral_Hat
What is this place anyway?
NAME:Voice 
My base!
NAME: 
As Leoht converses with the seemingly disembodied voice. Deor begins walking around the wall looking for a way in. After a minute or so he silently points to a spot on the wall. She nods and joins Deor as he activates the hidden entrance and enters. 
NAME:Voice 
PIC2:Hacker_Surprised
GAH! How did you get in here?
NAME:Leoht 
Through there.
NAME:Voice 
But, the-the cameras? How did you cut them all at once? That’s not possible!
NAME: 
Suddenly, the base’s alarm system goes off.
NAME:Voice 
PIC2:Hacker_Neutral
Damn it, it’s more of those creatures
NAME:Deor 
PIC1:Deorneutral
Doesn’t your base have defenses?
NAME:Voice 
Not anymore apparently!
