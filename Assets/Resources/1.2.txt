...Thanks. You–uh too?

PIC2:Deorangry
You’re fae, not human.
NAME: 
Assassin turns to point his knife edge up to Leoht.
NAME:Leoht 
Woah no no, please. I don’t mean any harm. We just fought together! 
I’m not your enemy, I just want to…
NAME: 
Leoht notices the dead wolf on the forest floor. It’s pulsing and contorted. 
She kneels down and begins to inspect it.
NAME:Assassin 
PIC2:Deorneutral
Why are you poking the corpse?
NAME:Leoht 
Don’t you think it’s strange how aggressive this wolf was?
NAME: Assassin 
glances back at Leoht’s glowing eyes and sparkling staff.
NAME:Assassin 
I think you’re the strange one.
NAME:Leoht 
What?
NAME:Assassin 
Happens quite often.
NAME:Leoht 
Its blood is the wrong color…
NAME:Assassin I don’t see what you mean.
NAME:Leoht 
It’s unnatural. I’ve seen something similar before in Niht–ah, my hometown. My people blamed me for it.
NAME:Assassin 
?
NAME:Leoht 
It’s nothing.
NAME:Leoht 
...        
NAME:Leoht 
So… you aren’t going to fight me?
NAME:Assassin 
No. I don’t think I need to.
NAME:Leoht 
Well, do you want to come with me then? I don’t have anywhere to go back to, so I’m just going to keep exploring.
NAME:Assassin 
I just threatened to kill you.
NAME:Leoht 
But you haven’t.
NAME:Assassin 
...Yeah, fair enough. I’ll go with you. I don’t have anything else to do either.
NAME:Leoht 
And your name?
NAME:Assassin 
...
NAME:Deor 
Deor. 
So, where are we going?
NAME:Leoht 
To find out what’s happening with these creatures.
