NAME:Deor 
PIC1:Deorneutral
No. Look, there seems to be some sort of entrance here.

Seems like the beginning of the labyrinth.
NAME: 
The party enters the dark tunnel and begins their search for The Creators. It doesn’t take long for the air to become still and tunnel to chill.
NAME:Leoht 
The air is dark here. It feels almost sick.
NAME:Beda 
PIC1:Hacker_Neutral
Guess we’re almost there then.
NAME: 
An ear-piercing sound echoes through the labyrinth and the group covers their ears in an attempt to block out the shrieking roar.
NAME:Earl 
PIC1:Earlangry
Time to end this!
NAME:Beda
PIC1:Hacker_Happy
